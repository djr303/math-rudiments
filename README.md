# Math rudiments

* TypeScript
* To the power of 10??
* Addition, subtraction, multiplication,division, primes

# TODOs:

## Division:

* Show factors and possibly factor pairs when getting division questions wrong.

# NOW:

1. TypeScript + config for power of base 10 calcs ( x * 10 ** x)
2. Bash runner
3. line in
4. process.exit
5. Run through all factorials (need development) when the answer is wrong
6. Possible number pairs / factorial pairs
7. Consider how we do this with bases: 2 ** n (8,4,2), (3 ** n, 9,6,3), consider approach here.


## Factorials

* Pairs, Triplets?
* Unit test based algorithm

### Notes:

* Resource (Primes, 1 - 1000) - https://byjus.com/maths/prime-numbers-from-1-to-1000/

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* NEW QUESTION SET: Finding factorial pairs of numbers
* Need input which relates to previous primes and larger pair operations
