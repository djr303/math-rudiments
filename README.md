# Math rudiments

* TypeScript
* To the power of 10
* Addition, subtraction, multiplication,division

# TODOs:

## Division:

* Show factors and possibly factor pairs when getting division questions wrong.

# NOW:

1. TypeScript + config for power of base 10 calcs
2. Bash runner
3. line in
4. process.exit
5. Run through all factorials (need development) when the answer is wrong
6. Possible number pairs / factorial pairs


## Factorials

* Pairs, Triplets?
* Unit test based algorithm
